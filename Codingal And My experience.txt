About My experience of the app making contest hosted by codingal(  https://www.codingal.com/competitions/iit-roorkee-e-summit-kids-app-innovation-challenge/  ):

	This competition gave a head start to me this year.
	I found this competition very intresting.I have told about this competition to some of my friends intrested in programming and they said that they will take part in this competition next time.


	I have made a SOS app which can help you in any type of emergency(Accident and Heart attack etc).I got this idea when i saw the statistics of deaths by heart attacks.
